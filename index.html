                Born in Tehuantepec, Oaxaca in the far south of Mexico, I made my way over here in the mid 2000s. From then I focused on school until I was accepted into the University of Nebraska at Omaha after graduating form Omaha North High Magnet. My original goal was to get a full ride scholarship and once I was able to achieve that, I made a new one. That is to graduate and find a job to provide for myself and my family. I have three brothers and an extremely cute <a href="loki.html">cat named loki</a> which is kind of funny because I'm allergic to cats. I work in retail and am currently chasing a couple of internships for the summer.
